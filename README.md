# Stegan_Group

This project was definitely a challenge, especially when trying to go and imagine the movements of bits and the process needed to make it all happen. The major, critical issue I ran into was the inability to properly test the code via files and the like.
As a result, I had to ask ChatGPT to give me a potential output, potential errors, and I used its judgement in certain cases. If this is an issue then I apologize, I tried for quite a while before giving in and continuing.

As for how I shared the work, I submitted a link via discord and sent said invite, though I never got a chance to share any of it via commits due to the time they joined.
